# PD_Speech_Dataset
This dataset was used in our manuscript "Stable Multi-label Speech Feature Selection for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Subtypes Recognition".
For details, in PD_Speech_Dataset.csv, except for the first row, each row corresponds to a speech sample, and each column represents a feature with the exception of the final three columns, which are labels.
